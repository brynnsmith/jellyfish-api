Moon jellies have short, delicate tentacles that hang down from the sides of the bell.

Overfishing, ocean warming, and pollution are all factors that reduce moon jellies\' predators and competitors and increase their prey. These results provide a more favorable environment for this species. As people continue to increase our ocean activities, the Moon Jelly may become one of the more successful species in the open ocean.'
